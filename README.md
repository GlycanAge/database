# Decentralized Glycan Database

## About

GlycoChain is the first glycan decentralized on-chain database in the world aiming to provide easy and available access to worldwide data on the human glycome. 

It is free for research purposes with the aim to expand its scope while it is paid for commercial uses.

GlycoChain is not only the first open-source glycan database that integrates the possibilities of web 3.0 it is actually the first-ever glycan database.

Under the guidance of Genos, the world’s leading glycomics laboratory as well as GlycanAge - the world’s first biological age testing kit utilizing glycan technology, as well as the large research institutions that focus on the human glycome analysis. GlycoChain will create a universal classification of different glycan structures allowing for the world's entire research in the field of glycomics to be easily comparable and allowing easy access and use for data analysis.

GlycoChain is open to everyone while data analysis will be paid for commercial purposes as it will allow monetization of the world’s scientific research in the field of glycomics.

Glycans are one of the main 4 building blocks of life and are the ultimate layer of complexity that can provide us with new discoveries in preventative and personalized medicine.

If decoding the Human Genome was like traveling to the Moon, decoding the Human Glycome is analogous to traveling to Mars. 

GlycoChain can be used as a staging ground for large data analysis and since it will allow standardization of glycan data it will allow easy third-party uses that can create their own proprietary technology and algorithms that can find exciting new discoveries.

## Problem

Glycans are the sugar molecules found on the surface of every cell and the majority of the proteins in our body - they are responsible for cell signaling as many other biological processes.

They are also progenitors of many inflammatory conditions that shorten the human lifespan as well as lead to the development of many autoimmune and chronic conditions.

Since glycans analysis was quite complicated until only 2 decades ago, there was a lack of understanding of their role and importance. As they are very complex and branched structures, there isn’t one world-recognized nomenclature that can be used to easily compare research from different facilities, slowing down the progress and making large-scale data analysis almost impossible.

## Solution

By creating the first open-source glycan database of the human glycome and creating an accepted nomenclature it will finally be easy for everyone with interests in personalized medicine to do their own research in the hopes of helping understand and prevent the majority of modern diseases.

As its uses will be free for research purposes GlycoChain will attract research institutions that wish to broaden their scope and understanding of the complexity of human life by contributing to it as well as using it to enhance their research.

With GlycoChain it will be possible to find new biological pathways, understand the progeniture of many autoimmune as well as chronic conditions as well as map new mechanisms that aim to prolong life and improve longevity.

## Why is this important?

Glycans are the final frontier in science with orders of magnitude more complexity than the human genome.

They are not coded in the DNA but are the result of a complex interplay of many biological processes. By mapping out the entire human glycome and understanding the role different glycans play it would be akin to understanding the programming language of life itself.

## Where will the funds go

GlycoChain is created under the tutelage of the Genos - world-leading glycan research facility as well as GlycanAge - the world’s first biological age testing kit that analyzes the direct effectors of low-grade chronic inflammation - glycans on the main protein of the immune system IgG.

The funds will go towards building the infrastructure needed to store and serve glycan data so that the technical capacity won’t limit the efforts of independent researchers as well as large research organizations and companies.

This will benefit everyone who wishes to better understand the progeniture of diseases in order to discover new biomarkers, or create personalized drugs. That will include entrepreneurs who can use the data in order to create algorithms that can be used to directly benefit the entirety of the scientific community as well as final users when it comes to improving health, prolonging life, and reducing the risk of diseases.
